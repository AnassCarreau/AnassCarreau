## 🎯 About Me: Transforming Latency into Performance

I am a **Software Engineer** with over **2.5 years of experience** specializing in **High-Performance Architecture**, **Real-time Simulation**, and **VR Systems**. My engineering philosophy bridges the gap between high-level gameplay logic and low-level memory management.

From developing **custom C++ game engines** to delivering production-grade VR simulations, my goal is consistent: **Efficiency, Scalability, and Clean Architecture.**

🚀 **Status:** Open to Full-time roles in Game Development (AAA/Indie) or Simulation Engineering.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### 🥽 **[Didascalias (Complutense University)](https://github.com/arome90/Didascalias)**
**Role: Lead Programmer & Tech Art Integrator**
> *Serious Game (VR) | C# | Unity | WebSockets | AI/NLP*

Solely responsible for the entire codebase of a production-grade VR simulation. I acted as the bridge between the Art team and the technical implementation, ensuring high-fidelity animations ran smoothly on standalone hardware (Quest 2/3).

* **⚡ Networking & Backend:** Engineered a real-time communication layer using **WebSockets** to sync VR state with an external Web Server dashboard.
* **🤖 AI & NLP:** Integrated **Wit.ai** for Natural Language Processing, enabling users to interact with virtual avatars via voice commands, adding a layer of immersive AI.
* **🎨 Tech Art Pipeline:** Collaborated daily with 3D artists to optimize rig animations and assets, enforcing strict GPU budgets that reduced draw calls by **28%**.
* **🚀 Optimization:** Achieved stable **72+ FPS** by implementing **spatial partitioning**, memory pooling, and reducing heap allocations by **45%**.
* **📈 Impact:** Performance tuning improved user session completion rates by **22%**.

### 🛠️ **Bertrandt Group**
**Role: Software Developer (C++)**
> *Automotive Tooling | C++17/20 | Profiling*

Developed high-performance internal tools for processing automotive engineering datasets.

* **🚀 Efficiency:** Accelerated data processing pipelines by **60%** through advanced profiling, cache optimization, and algorithmic improvements.
* **⚡ Responsiveness:** Optimized GUI components to achieve **sub-50ms response times** for critical user interactions.
* **💻 Modern C++:** Heavily utilized **C++17/20**, RAII, and STL optimizations, delivering production releases with **zero critical rollbacks**.

## 🧬 Engineering R&D & Personal Projects

### ⚙️ **[Custom Game Engine (Papagayos)](https://github.com/Papagayos-Games)**
> *C++ & Lua | OpenGL | Engine Architecture*
* **The Challenge:** Built a game engine from scratch to master the render pipeline. **Includes 2 complete games** developed within the engine to validate the architecture.
* **Key Tech:** Hybrid architecture using **C++** for the core engine and **Lua** for scripting and gameplay logic. Features a Custom ECS, OpenGL Rendering, and manual memory management.

### 🥊 **[Moruyankii Fighter](https://github.com/MoruyankiiFighter)**
> *C++ | STL | Low-Level Gameplay*
* **The Challenge:** A fighting game built without a commercial engine to practice efficient logic.
* **Key Tech:** Written in **C++** utilizing the **Standard Template Library (STL)**. Implemented deterministic state machines and input buffering structures from scratch.

### 🧪 **[While True Studio](https://github.com/while-true-studio)**
> *C# | Unity | Collaborative Development*
* **The Challenge:** Independent development studio focused on experimental gameplay and polished mechanics.
* **Key Tech:** Implementation of scalable modular systems for team collaboration, "juice" feedback algorithms, and iterative development of complex game loops.

---

## 🎓 Education

**Bachelor's Degree in Video Game Development**
*Complutense University of Madrid (2018 - 2022)*
* **Focus:** Game Engine Architecture, Real-Time Rendering, GPU Programming, and Advanced Algorithms.
