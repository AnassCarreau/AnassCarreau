## 🎯 About Me: Transforming Latency into Performance

I am a **Software Engineer** with a focus on **High-Performance Architecture** and **Real-time Simulation**. My engineering philosophy bridges the gap between gameplay logic and low-level memory management.

I don't just use engines; I understand how they work under the hood. From developing **custom C++ game engines** to maintaining large-scale production codebases in **C#**, my goal is always the same: **Efficiency, Scalability, and Clean Architecture.**

🚀 **Current Status:** Open to **Full-time roles** in Game Development (AAA/Indie) or Simulation Engineering.

## 💼 Professional Experience & Key Projects

### 🏢 **[Didascalias (Production Lead/Project at Complutense University)](https://github.com/arome90/Didascalias)**
*Professional Role (2 Years)*
> A robust simulation and management system developed and maintained over a 2-year production cycle.

* **Role:** Core Software Engineer.
* **Tech Stack:** C# (Advanced), Unity, System Architecture, VR/XR.
* **Key Achievement:** Managed the full software lifecycle, focusing on long-term code maintainability, feature scalability, and tool development for end-users. This project demonstrates my ability to handle **complex production pipelines** and deliver stable software updates over continuous iterations.

### ⚙️ **[Custom Game Engine (C++ R&D)](https://github.com/Papagayos-Games)**
*Personal Engineering Challenge*
> A custom-built game engine written from scratch to master low-level architecture.

* **Focus:** Memory Management, Rendering Pipelines (OpenGL), Data-Oriented Design.
* **Why it matters:** Proves deep understanding of pointer arithmetic, resource allocation, and the internal mechanics of how game engines process frames, beyond the abstraction layers of Unity or Unreal.

## 📂 Repository Overview: R&D and Prototypes

Beyond my core professional work, my GitHub serves as a laboratory for **Research & Development**.

You will find a progression of repositories ranging from **C# Gameplay Systems** (like *Moruyankii Fighter*) to **C++ Optimization Experiments**. These projects explore specific engineering challenges such as:
* **State Machine Implementations:** Decoupling logic for complex AI behaviors.
* **Render Pipeline Tests:** experimenting with shaders and graphics optimization.
* **Algorithm Implementations:** Testing data structures for speed and efficiency.

*Feel free to explore the repositories to see the evolution of my code quality and architectural thinking.*
